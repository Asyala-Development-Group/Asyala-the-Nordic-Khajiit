Asya'la: Do you have a minute?
 
  Player: Not right now.
    
    Asya'la: Oh... Okay.
  
  Player: Sure, what do you need?

    Asya'la: I just wanted to thank you for being my guide. I've seen so much of Skyrim already, it's more beautiful than I would have ever imagined. I may be a khajiit, but this is my homeland. While I would love to see Elsweyr someday, I've never been there.
