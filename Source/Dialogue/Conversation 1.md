Asya'la: Do you have a minute?
 
  Player: Not right now.
    
    Asya'la: Oh... Okay.
  
  Player: Sure, what do you need?

    Asya'la: I just wanted to thank you for being my guide. I've seen so much of Skyrim already, it's more beautiful than I would have ever imagined. I may be a khajiit, but this is my homeland. I've never been to Elsweyr, while it is where my people are from, it is not where I am from. This journey has been something special.
    
      Player: It's been my pleasure having you along.
      
        Asya'la: You as well.
        (Continue to "You must have had an interesting upbringing.)
      
      Player: Sure, as long as I'm getting paid.
      
        Asya'la: Oh... yeah. Well let's be off then.
        (End conversation.)
      
      Player: You must have had an interesting upbringing.
      
        Asya'la: You could say that.
