Asya'la: Do you have a minute?

    Player: Not right now.
    
        Asya'la: Oh... okay, another time then.
        
    Player: Sure, what do you need?
    
        Asya'la: Someting has been bothering me for a while, even before I met you. Have I told you about my mentor?
        
                Player: Remind me.
                
                        Asya'la: Her name was Jah'alaka, she was strict and unforgiving but is also a big reason that I am who I am today. I have a lot to thank her for. I'll be honest, I didn't like her at first but when she started discussing Khajiiti culture I gote entralled. It opened my eyes as to who I am. My favorite lessons covered the old Khajiiti tales, she had a way of spinning those stories into breathtaking tapestries of song. I love it. I hope to see her again some day. It's been so long since we last talked.

                Player: Yes, what about her?
                
                        Asya'la: I've just been thinking about her a lot lately. Being here in the Nordic homeland has had me thinking about myself. I'm a walking contridiction, a Nordic Khajiit? It's ridiculous.
                        
                                Player: It's not ridiculous, you are who are you.
                                
                                       Asya'la: Who am I? Am I a Nord or am I a Khajiit? My parents thought that bringing in a teacher would help me cope with who I was, but it has just left me more confused that ever. I've always considered myself a Nord, but I cannot deny that I am covered in fur and have pointed ears.
                                
                                Player: Yes, you are pretty odd.
                                
                                        Asya'la: Exactly.
