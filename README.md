Asya'la is a Khajiit raised by Nord parents and mentored by a learned Khajiiti scholar. This has resulted quite the unique mixture of Nordic and Khajiiti cultures. Though close-minded Nords may not think much of Khajiit, Asya'la is more a Nord than many of them. Brought up on the isolated island of Kottheim, Asya'la is much less Imperialzied than many Mainlanders, she follows the Old Nordic Pantheon and lived a life much more akin to the Nords of old. However, she also respects her people's traditions and worships many of the Khajiiti gods.

This has resulted in Asya'la not really sure where she is going or who she is, she has begun a journey of self discovery. After a boat ride from Kottheim, Asya'la waits in Windhelm for a guide to help her across the new and exciting province. Who she will be at the end will be left to be seen.
