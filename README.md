# Asya'la the Nordic Khajiit

Asya'la is a Khajiit raised by Nord parents on Kyne's Aegis since she was a cub. This has resulted in quite an interesting blend of Nordic culture and Khajiiti heritage. You will serve as Asya'la's guide for the majority of the mod but once you earn Asya'la's trust you will discover her purpose for traveling to Skyrim: she wants to establish a permeant temple to the Riddle'Thar so she can better serve them as a faithful worshipper. The problem is that in order to establish such a temple she requires two Moon Pearls which are quite hard to find in Skyrim. 

This will eventually lead Asya'la and the player to an ancient Falmer ruin that was one the Snow Elf monastery of Gandra. The place is in shambles and nearly impossible to navigate but they will find a very interesting discovery: an old Dragon Priest mask that will allow them to shift between the past and present at will. In the present there the ruin is near deserted besides a few corrupted Falmer but in the past you will see Gandra as it was at it's height. The time you shift will be during the Gandra's fall: Atmorans are storming the place and the Falmer are desperately trying to defend it. In the confusion both Atmoran and Falmer will be hostile to the player.
